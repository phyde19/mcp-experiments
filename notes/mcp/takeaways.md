# Takeaways

I guess the value is that we will have a lot of tool functionality up to the last mile of integration with a particular UI/UX presentation. So it's a way to reuse and share common functionality rather than the alternative of creating full LLM applications and then having to fork them or something on github.

Whoa. I think I just figured out a way to say this. MCP is like importing functionality into your AI app. It's analogous to what we get with importing packages in programming languages. When you pull in a python library or even better something like rust, you don't get a main function or an executable. You get a set of tooling you can pull into your client application

It's like libraries for LLMs.
